# MSTAR Datasheets
Collection of hard to find datasheets for MStar ICs.

If you have any please feel free to submit a Pull Request. 

If you look on line (*cough* http://en.pudn.com/ *cough*) you'll likely come across some source code to various
MStar platforms. Of interest will be the registers and the initialisation code. I haven't uploaded these due
to the unknown copyright status, but betwen that code and datasheets there should be enough to play with.
